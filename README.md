# People Counting and Tracking with YOLOv8

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to the People Counting and Tracking project! This project leverages YOLOv8 for detecting and tracking people in video footage. It identifies individuals as they enter or exit designated regions and visualizes these movements in real-time. This is ideal for various applications, including monitoring foot traffic and security.

## üéØ Features

- **Real-time People Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate and swift person detection.
- **Custom Tracking**: Tracks individuals across frames with unique IDs.
- **Region Detection**: Monitors entries and exits in predefined regions.
- **Overlay Visualization**: Includes a custom overlay to enhance visual output.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time updates on the number of people moving in and out of specified areas.

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/people-counting-tracking.git
   cd people-counting-tracking
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download YOLOv8 Model**

   Place the `yolov8n-pose.pt` model file in the project directory. You can download it from [Ultralytics YOLOv8 GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases).

5. **Prepare COCO Class Names**

   Save the COCO class names to a file named `coco.txt` in the project directory.

6. **Add Overlay Image**

   Place your overlay image (e.g., `graphics-1.png`) in the project directory.

## üìÇ Usage

1. **Set Up the Video Path**

   Edit the `path_video` variable in `main.py` to point to your video file.

2. **Run the Project**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Results**

   The application will open a window displaying the video with tracking and counting information. The overlay image and count of people entering or exiting the regions will be shown on the frame.

4. **Stop the Application**

   Press `q` while the window is focused to exit the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

- **Regions of Interest**: Modify the `Up` and `Down` lists to change the monitored areas.
- **Overlay Image**: Replace `graphics-1.png` with your own image for a customized display.
- **Model**: Use a different YOLO model or adjust model parameters as needed.
